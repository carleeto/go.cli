# go.cli -- tools for writing command-line utilities in Go.

This repository is something of a grab-bag to hold libraries I'm
working on for command-line tools in go. It includes, thus far:

- `completion/` -- tools for providing autocompletion to golang CLIs.
- `config/` -- a library for loading configuration from a file using a `FlagSet`.
